# libft
My very first own library

This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose 
functions my programs will rely upon.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them.
